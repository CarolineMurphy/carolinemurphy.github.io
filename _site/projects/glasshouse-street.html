<p>21 GLASSHOUSE STREET

    21 Glasshouse Street is a Grade II listed office building on Regent Street
    owned by the Crown Estate. I was a lead member working on the
    transformation to CAT A Office space which has now been let by Apple.
    The refurbishment has created 26,000 ft2
    of exemplary office space with
    a BREEAM Excellent.
    We inserted a new lift core which has enabled the relocation of the
    office entrance from Regent Street to Glasshouse Street unifying the
    existing retail street frontage that is dominant on Regent Street. I worked
    closely with Westminster City Council to create a unique bronze
    canopy that now frames the entrance. I also created the concept and
    brief for a carved solid stone desk that now sits in the reception and
    worked directly with stone sculptor Simon Hitchens from inception to
    completion.

    On the top floor we discovered an empty double height mansard which
    has been transformed into 4,000 ft2
    of prime office space with full height
    glass sliding doors that lead out to terrace, meadow and dramatic views
    across London.</p>
