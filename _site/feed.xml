&lt;br /&gt;
In my current role as Part III Architect at Studio RHE I have been running 9 Dallington Street, a 3000 M SQ, CAT B office refurbishment, fit out, and roof extension, with a bar and cafe in Shoreditch. I inherited this project at Stage 3 and prepared a planning application, in tandem with producing the detailed design and full tender package. I am responsible for the day to day running of this project, including attending design team meetings, monitoring site progress and giving client presentations. One of the key aspects of this project, as with any, has been managing client expectations. I thoroughly enjoy this aspect of my role as an architect, building lasting professional relationships and working collaboratively with the client and design team to deliver mutually considered, high quality projects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Studio Rhe" /><category term="current role" /><summary>Project Architect</summary></entry><entry><title>BARR GAZETAS - 2012 - 2015</title><link href="http://carolinemurphy.github.io/barr-gazetas/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="BARR GAZETAS - 2012 - 2015" /><published>2016-09-23T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-09-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://carolinemurphy.github.io/barr-gazetas</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://carolinemurphy.github.io/barr-gazetas/">&lt;p&gt;Key Project: QUADRANT ARCADE, REGENT STREET, LONDON&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
During my time at Barr Gazetas I contributed to a large range of projects in both size and sector, spanning stages 1 - 7 of the RIBA plan of work. Key projects include the retrofit of three Grade II listed buildings on Regent Street and an extension to The Michael Palin Centre in Clerkenwell. As protected sites, the schemes demanded thoughtful, sensitive and innovative planning, which proved to be both challenging and rewarding. I gained valuable on site exoerience and was a direct point of contact for the main contractor. I have also gained experience, and much success, in working with the directors to pitch for new work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Barr Gazetas" /><summary>Project Architect and Lead Designer</summary></entry><entry><title>LAWRAY ARCHITECTS SUMMER 2010</title><link href="http://carolinemurphy.github.io/lawray-architects/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LAWRAY ARCHITECTS SUMMER 2010" /><published>2016-09-22T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-09-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://carolinemurphy.github.io/lawray-architects</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://carolinemurphy.github.io/lawray-architects/">&lt;p&gt;Key Project: EGERTON CRESCENT, KENSINGTON&lt;br /&gt;
