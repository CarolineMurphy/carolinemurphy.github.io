# About

A hardworking, highly motivated and reliable individual with excellent organisational, communication and interpersonal skills. A passionate designer, I thrive on complex briefs and design challenges, approaching them with a positive can-do attitude and a firm belief that ongoing research and development is key to successful, sustainable projects. I have the ability to execute, present and prioritise ideas rationally and coherently with a keen eye for elegance in simplicity and through a range of media including hand drawings, physical modelling and CAD programmes.
