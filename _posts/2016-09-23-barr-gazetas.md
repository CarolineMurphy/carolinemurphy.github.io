During my time at Barr Gazetas I contributed to a large range of projects in both size and sector, spanning stages 1 - 7 of the RIBA plan of work. Key projects include the retrofit of three Grade II listed buildings on Regent Street and an extension to The Michael Palin Centre in Clerkenwell. As protected sites, the schemes demanded thoughtful, sensitive and innovative planning, which proved to be both challenging and rewarding. I gained valuable on site exoerience and was a direct point of contact for the main contractor. I have also gained experience, and much success, in working with the directors to pitch for new work.
