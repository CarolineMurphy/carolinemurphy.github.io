I was part of the architectural design team within a multidisciplinary office of planners and landscape architects. I worked on a range of projects including one off houses, a scheme for 350 affordable homes and a mixed use residential and commercial high-rise in the city of London. Whilst working at Barton Willmore, I tightened my time management abilities, gained experience in dealing with clients and grasped the reality of the professional demands and responsibilities of the architect.
