Key Project: 9 DALLINGTON STREET<br>
Overview: CAT B refurbishment and roof extension in Shoreditch.<br>
Role: Project Architect<br>
Client: Brockton Capital<br>
Sector: CAT B, Mixed-Use, Co-Working, Bar + Cafe<br>
Value: Â£9 million<br>
Stages: 3 - 4<br>
<br>
In my current role as Part III Architect at Studio RHE I have been running 9 Dallington Street, a 3000 M SQ, CAT B office refurbishment, fit out, and roof extension, with a bar and cafe in Shoreditch. I inherited this project at Stage 3 and prepared a planning application, in tandem with producing the detailed design and full tender package. I am responsible for the day to day running of this project, including attending design team meetings, monitoring site progress and giving client presentations. One of the key aspects of this project, as with any, has been managing client expectations. I thoroughly enjoy this aspect of my role as an architect, building lasting professional relationships and working collaboratively with the client and design team to deliver mutually considered, high quality projects.
