During the summer at Lawray I worked producing drawings and specifications for construction as well as preparing a tender submission. I also worked as the in-house graphic designer, assembling and laying out concept design, feasibility and technical reports. I designed and bound a series of booklets outlining the work of the practice categorised into relevant sectors.
